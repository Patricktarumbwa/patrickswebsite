    <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 3</h1>
    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
    <p>I believe I could have used Trello more effectively by labelling work properly, adding due dates and making checklists. This would have given me better time management. Visual Studio however was quite efficient and versatile. Being in teams would have helped managed the extensive amount of work to complete but could have led to a disjointed website with different themes.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
    <p>In order to be more efficient it would be necessary to plan out work and use the Kanban methodology to design, manage and improve workflows. Furthermore, working on code on a separate platform such as Notepad, then testing it extensively on Visual Studio Code could prevent any issues being created.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
    <p>Working in teams would be essential in future projects. This would leverage on peoples differing skills - with some more focused on the structure and thus using HTML, while others who are more adept at styling would code using CSS. This would be managed through Slack with Trello being used to understand the workflow and set deadlines.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
    <p>Digital testing involves viewing the digital product as if you were the user and navigating through the product from their perspective. In the case of a website, it would mean launching the website and testing if the functions work. Additionally, you can crowdsource the testing by allowing people to view your site and stress test the features.</p>
