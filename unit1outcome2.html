    <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 2</h1>
    <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
    <p>The most frequently used tools for the project were Trello, Slack and Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code was used the most as I would build the code through it and essentially developed the website through it. Trello, whilst useful, was used less frequently as it became cumbersome to fill in information whilst I was frantically trying to build the website at the same time. Slack was of paramount importance as it allowed me to post my code, review it and gain information from the course that was posted on Slack for reference.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
    <p>All the IT tools were appropriate although some were more relevant than others. Visual Studio Code was extremely useful and versatile as it allowed me to code HTML, CSS and Python on one platform. Trello, whilst appropriate, felt more useful as a place to store information than to manage workflow.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
    <p>The website I created was functional. I spent more time on the HTML - which meant getting the structure and flow of content correct. However, I could have spent more time styling the website and adding more CSS related content to make it look better.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
    <p>Overall, the website could look and feel better. Navigating it could be made easier. In addition having navigation buttons, better structure and layout as well as a more pleasing aesthetic, would make the website better. This could mean more CSS input in the project.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
    <p>One of the first requirements was to prepare appropriate content for the website which was executed properly in this case. All content was carefully researched and referenced. All the information was effectively organised and coded using HTML and CSS. This information was linked across different pages and all pages were error free as required for the project.</p>
