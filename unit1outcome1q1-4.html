    <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 1, Questions 1.1 - 1.4:</h1>
    <h2> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

    <p>Technology is a fundamental aspect of modern business. Not only does it underpin modern business functions, but it also acts as the basis of modern organisations. Over and above this, Information Technology also supports global trade and business [1]. It functions within the internal and external scope of a business.For example, IT can act as a function within a business - information is stored in database which are managed by IT professionals. It can also be used within businesses as a way to transform processes such as the technological automation of supply chains.IT can also be the core of a business. An example includes Netflix, which uses big data technology to understand patters in viewership and recommends programs according peoples preferences [2]. Ultimately, external use of technology and IT is also previlent with 4G and 5G technologies used by many businesses to support communication and ease of doing business [3].</p>

    <h2> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
    <p>Organisations need to consider a range of things when delivering successful digital projects. The first consideration should be the different hardware and software options available. Regarding hardware, it would be important to have computers that have the requisite memory and processing power for the project.When it comes to software, there are various software options. For building the code, one can consider using VS Code as it is a free option and is widely used. Other options could include Atom, Vim and Emacs [4].Furthermore, an organisation may need to think of the necessary coding language that are suitable for the digital project whether it is python, html, and other coding languages suitable for the project. It is important to also think of project management software such as Trello and Asana that could be used to manage the workflow of the project.Using a method called Kanban an organisaiton can design, manage and improve its workflow and complete the project successfully [5]. Ultimately, having a good team with the right skills of communication, time management, listening and organisational skills is essential to execute a good digital project.</p>

    <h2> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
    <p>In order to plan and carry out tasks, it is essential to have a method to manage the workflow.Kanban is an essential method to plan out a projects workflow. It allows an organisation to look at all the tasks that have to be completed, organise them into a suitable and manageable fashion and then execute them.Kanban creates a visual flow of the work, design the Work-In-Process (WIP) and limit the amount of WIP that is present. It is a way to make sure that an organisation and team can continuously improve its processes regarding project management of a website [6].</p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
    <p>There are numerous risks that impact digital projects. The first major risks regards allocating the necessary resources to a project. These include the financial resources, human resources and organisational resources.A business needs to provide enough finances to make a digital project successful. Additionally, having people with the right skills and attitude to execute a project is important. The organisation also needs to be prepared for change and may need to manage its day-to-day tasks alongside the digital project which it aims to implement [7]. There is also management risk. Where management does not execute on tasks effectively resulting in wasted time and money as well as not fully testing and sorting out issues with the project on time.
