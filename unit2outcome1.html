    <h1>Unit 2: Outcome 1</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page.</h2>
    <p>The website consists of a home page followed by pages dedicated to the answers for the course questions ranging from outcome questions 1 to 3. These are ordered from 1.1 to 1.7 continuously for each question and set as a page (with others grouped together). There is also a contact page at the end.</p>

    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
    <p>Websites are increasingly easy to copy both content and images, therefore it
    is important to register a website. There are some ways to detect infringement to your website, such as Copyscape which compares your own website to other ones to see if there is any clear duplication [1].Additionally, it is important to make sure that the content that is placed on the website is affected by copyright and its infringement. This includes the text, software code and databases. However, with HTML and CSS it is difficult to prove copying due to the simple syntax and limited vocabulary [2].</p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
    <p>There are numerous accessibility issues that are present for people with disabilities on webpages. For example, people who are visually impaired may need audible output such as screen readers to read the web content.This option can also be used for people who have dyslexia or similar learning disabilities.
    Furthermore, people with physical disabilities may not be able to use a mouse or keyboard, therefore the webpage may need to be designed to allow for assistive technologies such as speech recognition, head pointers, mouth sticks or eye-gaze tracking systems [3]. In such cases, the design of the website needs to be accessible and easy to function [4].</p>
    <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <p>Websites can afford certain filetypes that are appropriate and useful for viewing. HTML and CSS provide a basis for websites. HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage whilst CSS is useful for the format of a webpage [5].For graphics, Joint Photographics Expert Group (JPEG) is usually the most popular choice. Additionally, GIF's which are smaller sized files which contain colours, images and text can be sued for websites [6].</p>
