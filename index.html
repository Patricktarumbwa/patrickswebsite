    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h2> Here is a little bit about me: </h2>

    <p>I am an MBA and Masters in Management graduate with a passion for business and start-ups! Having worked in a range of companies from large financial corporations to small start-ups, I realised that technology is a fundamental aspect of all business transactions.
    After doing an entrepreneurship program for a year, I realised the power of tech in entrepreneurship. I wanted to learn more. Code Nation gives me a practical way to express my entrepreneurial skills by being creative and learning how to build tech products.</p>

    <h2>This website will showcase my work for my CodeNation course: my CSS and HTML learning:)</h2>
